    3. Write a precursor to a menu-driven program.The program should display a menu
    offering four choices, each labeled with a letter. If the user responds with a letter
    other than one of the four valid choices, the program should prompt the user to
    enter a valid response until the user complies.Then the program should use a
    switch to select a simple action based on the userâ€™s selection. A program run could
    look something like this:
    Please enter one of the following choices:
    c) carnivore           p) pianist
    t) tree                g) game
    f
    Please enter a c, p, t, or g: q
    Please enter a c, p, t, or g: t
